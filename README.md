# Discord-bot
Tried my hand at making a discord bot all it does is give quotes, and greet you hello and goodbye in a greetings channel
- was more of a test run of what can be done with discord bots kinda like asking google home or alexia random words

- Python + replit to run 
- I also included comments to alternatives like a .env variable
